                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Some fans believe Mulder and Scully's connection goes beyond the professional — or even the romantic. Certain episodes *accidentally* look like a slow-burn sci-fi romance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One widely loved fan theory says Mulder once wrote poetry about Scully under the alias "Mr. Spooky M," discovered in an unused case file marked “Classified & Personal.”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In a *very* unofficial fanfic lost to time (but not imagination), Scully and Scully’s clone from an alternate dimension allegedly got into a heated argument about who Mulder really loved.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A viral headcanon suggests Mulder and Skinner had a secret late-night “stakeout” routine that mysteriously always ended in the same parked car and… long silences.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    LGBTQ+ fans have long speculated that beneath Mulder’s obsession with aliens is an alienation of identity — and that his “true quest” was for acceptance, not just proof.
