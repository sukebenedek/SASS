        <p>
            From glowing saucers to mysterious black triangles, UFOs have been spotted by civilians, military pilots,
            and even astronauts. These sightings fuel decades of debate: Are we alone, or are we being observed?

        <p class="intro">
            Across decades, skies have been pierced by unidentified flying objects â€” silent, swift, and utterly
            unexplained. From grainy footage to pilot testimonies, the truth seems just out of reach.

    In the 20th and 21st centuries, technology caught up with folklore. Pilots from commercial airlines to military jets have logged encounters with fast-moving, unidentified crafts. Some reports describe the objects accelerating from 0 to Mach 10 in a blink â€” without sonic booms or heat trails. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_UFO_videos">The infamous 2004 Nimitz incident</a> remains one of the most credible encounters to date.

            For centuries, civilizations across the globe have reported sightings of strange objects in the sky â€” crafts
            that defy gravity, blink in impossible patterns, or disappear into thin air. Ancient cave drawings depict
            flying discs; medieval manuscripts mention "fire in the heavens." The phenomenon predates modern flight,
            begging the question: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_UFO_videos">have they always been watching?</a>
